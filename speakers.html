                    <h5>Death to Wireframes: Long Live Rapid Prototyping</h5>
                    <p>Static wireframes are a drag on the whole design process. Prototyping makes things a little
                        better by allowing you to stitch together static wireframes or mockups while adding basic
                        interactions. Rapid prototyping with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript is even better and faster; it
                        increases collaboration and improves the iteration process. Kill your wireframes. Long live
                        rapid prototyping.</p>

                    <h5>What Designers and Strategists Can Learn from Dick Fosbury</h5>
                    <p>Dick Fosbury is an American track and field athlete who challenged the conventional approach to
                        the high jump with an unorthodox &#8220;back first&#8221; technique that became known as the
                        Fosbury Flop. His innovative approach to a sport that seemed to have reached its limits was
                        ridiculed at first, with sportswriters labeling him &#8220;the world&#8217;s laziest high
                        jumper&#8221; &#8212; but today variations of the Fosbury Flop are used by almost every high
                        jumper.</p>
                    <p>We need to challenge conventions, too. Many of the design conventions used in web, mobile and
                        device interfaces have evolved from systems and processes that no longer connect with our
                        audiences&#8217; realities: a floppy disk as a metaphor to &#8220;save&#8221; information, push
                        buttons as control devices and typography standards derived from mechanical typesetting.</p>
                    <p>As designers and strategists, we need to think like Dick Fosbury, to deconstruct analogues, and
                        to free ourselves from outdated ideas so that we can develop the new interfaces and interactions
                        of the future.</p>
                    <h5>About Brad</h5>
                    <p>Brad Smith is executive director for WebVisions, a conference that explores the future of the
                        web. Most recently he launched &#8220;The Institute for Social Good,&#8221; an organization that
                        connects non-profits with volunteers willing to spend a day building awesome web and mobile apps
                        to change the world for the better.</p>

                    <p>It&#8217;s not uncommon for developers and designers to work from home. There are also a few
